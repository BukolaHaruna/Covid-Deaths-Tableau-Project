# Covid-Deaths-Tableau-Project

The COVID-19 Dashboard provides an interactive visualisation of COVID-19 data, presenting key metrics and trends related to the pandemic.

# Summary
- Global Numbers (Top Table)
  * Total Cases: 150,574,977
  * Total Deaths: 3,180,206
  * Death Percentage: 2.11% <br /> 
Insight: The death rate remains relatively low compared to total cases, indicating improvements in treatment, healthcare responses, or underreporting of mild cases.
- Total Deaths per Continent
  * Europe has the highest total deaths, followed by North America, South America, and Asia.
  * Africa and Oceania have significantly lower death counts. <br />
Insight: The high death toll in Europe and North America may be due to higher case numbers, older populations, or early pandemic impact. Africaâ€™s lower numbers could indicate fewer reported cases due to limited testing.
- Percent of Population Infected Per Country (Map - Top Right)
  * Shaded regions represent the percentage of the population infected in different countries.
  * Some regions (e.g., North America) have higher infection rates compared to others. <br />
Insight: The pandemic did not affect all regions equally. Some countries had higher infection rates due to population density, testing, and public health policies.
- Percent Population Infected Over Time (Line Chart - Bottom Right)
  * Tracks infection rates in different countries (e.g., U.S., U.K., Canada, Nigeria, India, etc.) from Dec 2019 to Oct 2021.
  * The U.S. and U.K. have the highest infection rates, while countries like Nigeria have lower reported cases. <br />
  
Insight:
* Countries with higher testing and reporting mechanisms show steeper trends.
* Developing countries may have lower reported infections due to limited testing.
* The growth trend suggests multiple waves of COVID-19. <br />

These elements collectively offer a comprehensive view of the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling users to analyze trends, compare regional impacts, and assess the effectiveness of interventions.
